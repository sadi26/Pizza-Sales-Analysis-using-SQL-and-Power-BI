# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL-and-Power-BI
The project involves analyzing a full dataset of a pizza store's activities in 2015. The dataset, originally in CSV format, is migrated to a MySQL server for streamlined querying. The project's main goal is to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) and valuable insights from the data, empowering informed decision-making for the pizza business.
