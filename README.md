# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL-and-Power-BI
Project Description:

The "Pizza Sales" project is a comprehensive analysis endeavor that delves into a complete dataset from a pizza store's operations throughout the year 2015. The provided dataset, initially formatted in CSV format, has been migrated and integrated into a MySQL server for efficient querying and analysis. The primary objective of this project is to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) and valuable insights from the data, enabling informed decision-making for the pizza business.

Project Steps:
Data Acquisition and Migration:
The project begins with the acquisition of the CSV-formatted dataset, containing detailed information about the pizza store's transactions, products, customers, orders, and sales. This dataset is then migrated to a MySQL server, ensuring data integrity and structured storage for seamless querying.

Data Cleansing and Preparation:
Before conducting any analysis, the data is thoroughly cleansed and transformed to rectify any inconsistencies or errors. This step ensures that the subsequent analysis is based on accurate and reliable data.

SQL Database Design and Querying:
A well-structured database schema is designed to effectively organize the various aspects of the pizza store's operations. SQL queries are formulated and executed to extract meaningful insights and KPIs. Some potential queries include:

Total sales revenue for the year.
Best-selling pizza flavors.
Customer demographics and ordering trends.
Busiest days and times for orders.
Average order value.
Monthly sales growth rate.
Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Calculation:
Essential KPIs are calculated using SQL queries to measure the performance and success of the pizza store. These KPIs may encompass metrics such as sales growth, customer retention rates, average order value, and more. These insights aid in understanding the store's strengths and areas for improvement.

Power BI Dashboard Creation:
The extracted insights and KPIs are then visualized through a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard presents the data using charts, graphs, and tables, enabling stakeholders to gain a comprehensive overview of the store's performance throughout the year. The visuals allow users to drill down into specific details, further enhancing the decision-making process.

Insights and Recommendations:
Based on the analysis presented in the Power BI dashboard, the project concludes with actionable insights and recommendations. These insights guide the pizza store's management in making strategic decisions to optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance profitability.

In summary, the "Pizza Sales" project seamlessly combines SQL database management and Power BI visualization to transform raw data into actionable insights. By leveraging these tools, the project offers a holistic view of the pizza store's performance in 2015, facilitating data-driven decision-making for continued success.
